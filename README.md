## ‚ö†Ô∏è Auth0 Management API Use Notice

This tool makes use of the **Auth0 Management API**, which **consumes your tenant‚Äôs [rate limits](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/operational-policies/rate-limit-policy/rate-limit-configurations)**. Use it thoughtfully to avoid throttling.

Checkmate for Auth0 is designed to provide visibility into its behavior through your Auth0 tenant's [log events](https://auth0.com/docs/deploy-monitor/logs). Tracking its use is important for monitoring and debugging purposes. You can track its use in several ways, including:

-  The `User-Agent` string in the HTTP request header, which will have a value in the form of `${packageName}/${packageVersion}` (e.g. `auth0-checkmate/1.2.14`). Keep in mind that if the `User-Agent` string is modified on the client side, then Checkmate for Auth0 usage cannot be tracked this way.
- The `client_name` and `scopes` assigned to Checkmate when configuring initial access
- `seccft` events (Successful exchange of Access Token for a Client Credentials Grant) in Auth0 logs

As an example, Checkmate activity might result in a log entry like the one shown below. Each field in the log entry provides valuable information for troubleshooting or auditing, such as the `client_name` identifying the application, the `scope` showing granted permissions, and the `user_agent` indicating the tool version used.

```json

  "date": "2025-08-05T19:19:43.071Z",
